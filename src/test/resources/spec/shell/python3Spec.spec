#
# Pythons in RHEL/Fedora used different names for some architectures
# than upstream and other distros (for example ppc64 vs. powerpc64).
# This was patched in patch 274, now it is sedded if %%with legacy_archnames.
#
# That meant that an extension built with the default upstream settings
# (on other distro or as an manylinux wheel) could not been found by Python
# on RHEL/Fedora because it had a different suffix.
# This patch adds the legacy names to importlib so Python is able
# to import extensions with a legacy architecture name in its
# file name.
# It work both ways, so it support both %%with and %%without legacy_archnames.
#
# WARNING: This patch has no effect on Python built with bootstrap
# enabled because Python/importlib_external.h is not regenerated
# and therefore Python during bootstrap contains importlib from
# upstream without this feature. It's possible to include
# Python/importlib_external.h to this patch but it'd make rebasing
# a nightmare because it's basically a binary file.

Python %{pybasever} is an accessible, high-level, dynamically typed, interpreted
programming language, designed with an emphasis on code readability.
It includes an extensive standard library, and has a vast ecosystem of
third-party libraries.

The %{pkgname} package provides the "%{exename}" executable: the reference
interpreter for the Python language, version 3.
The majority of its standard library is provided in the %{pkgname}-libs package,
which should be installed automatically along with %{pkgname}.
The remaining parts of the Python standard library are broken out into the
%{pkgname}-tkinter and %{pkgname}-test packages, which may need to be installed
separately.

Documentation for Python is provided in the %{pkgname}-docs package.

Packages containing additional libraries for Python are generally named with
the "%{pkgname}-" prefix.

%description -n %{pkgname}-debug
python3-debug provides a version of the Python runtime with numerous debugging
features enabled, aimed at advanced Python users such as developers of Python
extension modules.

This version uses more memory and will be slower than the regular Python build,
but is useful for tracking down reference-counting issues and other bugs.

The debug build shares installation directories with the standard Python
runtime. Python modules -- source (.py), bytecode (.pyc), and C-API extensions
(.cpython*.so) -- are compatible between this and the standard version
of Python.

The debug runtime additionally supports debug builds of C-API extensions
(with the "d" ABI flag) for debugging issues in those extensions.

Python %{pybasever} package for developers.

This package exists to allow developers to test their code against an older
version of Python. This is not a full Python stack and if you wish to run
your applications with Python %{pybasever}, see other distributions
that support it, such as CentOS or RHEL or older Fedora releases.
